        How is it different from a surveillance camera?
      </dt>
      <dd>
        This device could be used as a surveillance camera also, but that would be like using an iPhone as a fixed line phone. The amazing software that comes with this device not only gives you an alert whenever it sees any movement nearby, but also sends images to your phone whenever anyone laughs or smiles! It works when you're not there, but also when you're there at home!

        Would I be flooded with photographs?
      </dt>
      <dd>
        Well, we don't just take any pictures. We capture a lot of moments, but our filtering algorithms limit the number of pictures you get. You can easily choose between getting all the great moments, or only the best of the best moments, so that we understand your requirements better. </p>
